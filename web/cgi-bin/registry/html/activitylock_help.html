    <h1>Dynamo application locks API</h1>
    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <p>
      This API is used to block / unblock execution of dynamo applications. Each Dynamo application creates and
      holds a lock while it executes. External entities that need to block dynamo execution for a period of time can request
      to lock its applications. Locks are identified by the application name, requesting user, and optionally the
      "service name". Service name is used if a user is managing locks in behalf of some system (e.g. Unified).
      Only users and services with permissions can make changes to the lock database (read-only functions are available to
      everyone). Please write a message to the HN hn-cms-dmDevelopment (DataManagement Developers) to obtain a
      permission.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is NO browser-friendly interface for application locks at the moment, aside from this manual page. Use
      cURL to access the API:
      <pre>
        curl -k --cert <i>proxy</i> --key <i>proxy</i> 'https://dynamo.mit.edu/registry/activitylock/<i>command</i>[?<i>options</i>]'
      </pre>
      where <i>proxy</i> is a valid CMS grid proxy and <i>command</i> is one of the commands listed below. <br>
      <span style="color:red;">Note that authentication with grid proxies work only with cURL+OpenSSL, which is not the default build in Scientific Linux and CentOS. CMS environment sourced from CVMFS provides a working configuration.</span>
    </p>

    <h3>Examples</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Lock detox:
        <pre>
          activitylock/lock?app=detox
        </pre>
        When the lock is successful, an "OK: Lock active" message is sent back as a JSON string. If the application is already locked by
        another user, a "Failed: application already locked" message is sent back.
      </li>
      <li>Lock detox as a service user "prodsystem":
        <pre>
          activitylock/lock?service=prodsystem&amp;app=detox
        </pre>
      </li>
      <li>Unlock detox:
        <pre>
          activitylock/unlock?app=detox
        </pre>
        Only locks created by your user name and service name can be released.
      </li>
      <li>Check the lock status:
        <pre>
          activitylock/check
        </pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
